Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
What if you can not use additional data structures?

Answer:

checkUnique(str)
The following algorithm is going to check if there is any unique character in the string 'str' :
1) [Initialize counter] set i = 0
2) Repeat step 3 and 4 while str[i] != NULL
3) set j = i + 1
4) Repeat step 5 while while str[j] != NULL
5) if str[i] = str[j] then return 0
6) return 1 [After end of step 2]
