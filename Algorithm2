Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer.
NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine, an extra copy of the array is not.

Answer:

checkUnique(str)
The following algorithm is going to check if there is any unique character in the string 'str' :
1) [Initialize counter] set i = 0,flag = 0
2) Repeat step 3,4 and 8 while str[i] != NULL
3) set j = i + 1
4) Repeat step 5 to 7 while while str[j] != NULL
5) if str[i] = str[j] then initiate the function deleteChar()
6) set flag = 1 and j = j - 1
7) j = j + 1
8) i = i + 1

deleteChar(str,j)
The following algorithm is going to delete the duplicate character and shift the upcoming characters.
str is the complete string, j is the position which character will be deleted.
1) [Initialize counter] i = j
2) Repeat step 3 & 4 while str[i] != NULL
3) str[i] = str[i+1]
4) i = i + 1 
5) Exit
